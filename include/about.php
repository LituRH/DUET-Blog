<p><font color="black">Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology, Gazipur is one of the reputed universities for the study in Bangladesh. The University originated in 1980 as a Faculty of Engineering under the University of Dhaka offering four years ' Bachelor degree in Civil ,Electrical and Electronic and Mechanical Engineering ' to help meet the growing need for advanced engineering education in Bangladesh. With new technologies appearing faster than developing countries can absorb them, the technology gap between developing and industrialized nations continue to widen at an alarming rate. A major reason for this widening gap is the lack of skilled engineers capable of integrating new technologies into existing, systems and networks. To alleviate this situation by educating engineers with the ability to plan, administer and manage the latest technologies, in June, 1986, under its name of Bangladesh Institute of Technology, Dhaka, the Institute became an autonomous institution empowered to award degrees. From 1st September 2003, the Institute has started its journey as a full-fledged University named as Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology, Gazipur. Till today, it has produced around 5856 graduates in different branches of engineering and has established a good reputation all over the world for the quality of its graduates. The curricula of DUET,Gazipur address the regions' practical needs, present and future, through undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>
